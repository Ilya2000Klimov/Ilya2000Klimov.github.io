This HITS (Heliophysics Innovation in Technology and Science) SDO(Solar Dynamics Observatory) project, titled “SDO Exploration And Research Community for Heliophysics”, aims to harness the incredible democratization of machine learning to create cutting edge scientific infrastructure and tools that advance NASA science.

Summary:
The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has revolutionized the field of heliophysics by recording 1-2 TB data/day and having a nominal lifetime data volume of > 1000 PetaBytes. Labeling such data requires a monumental effort, but novel techniques of machine learning can help lessen this load significantly. Here we propose to create a machine learning pipeline, on large amounts of unlabeled SDO data, to find clusters of solar images representing similar features. Furthermore, in an age of increasingly open-source collaborative frameworks, the democratization of machine learning presents the heliophysics community with an invaluable opportunity to broaden and deepen the development of programs aimed at collaborating with the general public. Here we present a project program for the involvement of the community college, underrepresented minorities, citizen scientists, and the wider general public in the development and application of machine learning algorithms to address heliophysics needs.
